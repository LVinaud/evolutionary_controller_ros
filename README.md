# evolutionary_controller_ros

Evolutionary controller for the diff-drive robot of the [`prm_2026`](https://github.com/matheusbg8/prm_2026) package, course SSC0712 (Mobile Robot Programming — USP São Carlos, 2026).

## What this package does

The `prm_2026` package (from the professor) provides the **platform**: Gazebo world, robot with sensors, `ros2_control` controllers, ROS↔Gazebo bridges. It defines the **Capture The Flag** scenario (world `arena_cilindros.sdf`, internally `capture_the_flag_world`) — two bases, two flags, a deploy zone, walls and cylinders — but does not implement the game logic. It only ships stubs in `controle_robo.py` and `robo_mapper.py`.

This package is the **brain**: it implements evolutionary algorithms that learn policies for the robot to solve the CTF task (leave the base, find the opponent's flag, grab it with the gripper, bring it to the deploy zone).

**Separation principle:** `prm_2026` stays untouched. We consume the topics it publishes (`/scan`, `/odom`, `/odom_gt`, `/robot_cam/labels_map`) and publish to the topics it consumes (`/cmd_vel`, `/gripper_controller/commands`). Nothing more.

## Design decisions

This section documents the choices that shape the evolutionary part. The rationale behind each one lives here so the repo is self-describing; the same notes are mirrored in the agent's persistent memory (`memory/project_gp_approach.md`).

### Learning approach: typed Genetic Programming

- **Representation:** strongly-typed GP tree (types `Bool`, `Float`, `Action`), **not** a neural network, NEAT graph, or potential fields. Chosen for interpretability (we can read the champion) and because an IC on evolutionary algorithms makes GP the most natural extension.
- **Execution model:** *reactive and stateless* — no memory between ticks. Every decision comes from the current sensor reading.
- **Function set:** `AND/OR/NOT` (Bool→Bool), `LT/GT` (Float→Bool), `IF(Bool, Action, Action)→Action`. No arithmetic for now; we add it if a champion is bottlenecked by the lack of it.
- **Terminal set:**
  - **Bool terminals** pre-cooked with YAML-tunable thresholds: `obstaculo_frente/esq/dir`, `bandeira_inimiga_visivel`, `bandeira_esquerda/direita/centralizada`, `segurando_bandeira`, `na_base_propria`, `na_zona_deploy`, `base_inimiga_visivel`.
  - **Float terminals** raw (normalized to `[-1, 1]`): cone distances, target angles/distances, linear/angular velocity.
  - **ERC** (ephemeral random constants), `Float` values spawned at tree-creation time and mutable later.
- **Action set (7):** `FRENTE`, `RE`, `GIRA_ESQ`, `GIRA_DIR`, `PARAR`, `PEGAR`, `SOLTAR`.
- **Leaf duration (E3 style):** each leaf is `(Action, duration_ms)`. The controller becomes a mini state machine — the current action runs for its declared duration; the tree is re-evaluated only when it expires. Three leaf mutations: swap action, swap duration, swap whole leaf.

### Selection and bloat control

- **Selection:** ε-lexicase with adaptive ε via MAD (La Cava, 2016). For each case, `ε = median(|xᵢ − median(x)|)` computed across the population in the current generation. Preserves specialists — champions that excel on one hard scenario are not averaged out.
- **Bloat control:** *lexicase parsimony* — `−size(tree)` is appended as an extra case. No α hyperparameter; lexicase itself decides when tree size is the discriminating case. Scales naturally with MAD.
- **Reproduction:** Koza-style — each child is **either** crossover (`crossover_rate=0.9`) **or** mutation (`0.1`), never both. Type-respecting crossover; five mutation operators (subtree, point, leaf-action swap, leaf-duration swap, ERC perturbation).
- **Elitism:** `elite_k=1` by default; the elitism code path is parametric so we can raise K without a code change.

### Fitness: 7 metrics × N scenarios, no aggregation

Fitness is **not** a scalar. Each episode produces 7 sub-metrics:

| # | Metric | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| a | `espaco_explorado` (unique 0.5 m grid cells visited) | MAX |
| b | `tempo_bandeira_visivel` (ticks enemy flag is on camera) | MAX |
| c | `pegou_bandeira` (0/1) | MAX |
| d | `dist_min_zona_deploy_com_bandeira` (min distance to deploy while holding) | MIN |
| e | `entregou_bandeira` (0/1) | MAX |
| f | `colisoes` (debounced collision events) | MIN |
| g | `tempo_ate_entrega` (`tempo_max` if never delivered) | MIN |

MIN metrics are negated (`-x`) so every case follows the "larger is better" convention lexicase expects. We do **not** rescale to `[0,1]`: MAD adapts to each case's natural scale.

With `len(scenarios)` scenarios, the final fitness vector has `7 × len(scenarios)` entries — **not** averaged. A champion that fails scenario A but dominates B is not collapsed into a mediocre mean.

### Delivery is pressure, not a gift

`episode.py` does not teach the tree to deliver. It only **observes**: a transition `holding_flag: True → False` *inside the deploy-zone radius* counts as delivery (and triggers early-stop for the episode). The tree has to learn to emit `SOLTAR` at the right place; if we gave free delivery, the tree would never evolve that skill.

While `holding_flag=True`, `episode.py` teleports the enemy flag model to the robot's pose each tick via `ign service set_pose`. On release the flag stays where it was dropped.

### /odom vs /odom_gt

- `gp_controller` (the robot's "brain") uses only `/odom` — wheel odometry, with drift. That is what the robot *knows*.
- `episode.py` (the trainer, external) uses `/odom_gt` (ground truth) for fitness metrics that need the true pose (exploration grid, collision radius, deploy distance).

Never mix: feeding `/odom_gt` into the tree's features would give the policy information it cannot access at deploy time.

### Target poses: discovered, never hardcoded

The orchestrator queries `/world/<name>/pose/info` **once** at startup (via `ign topic -e -n 1`) and extracts the positions of `blue_base`, `red_base`, `blue_flag`, `red_flag`, `flag_deploy_zone`. Those poses are passed to `gp_controller` as ROS parameters — "the robot knows where its base is" (a priori knowledge, realistic for CTF).

Adding a new scenario means editing the SDF; no code changes. Same for switching teams — `our_team: red` flips the label lookup tables and the base assignments, and `query_model_poses` supplies the right coordinates automatically.

### Collision detection

Event-based, not integral. An event fires when `min(cone distances in all 4 directions) < collision_radius_m`, with a debounce (`collision_debounce_s`) to prevent double-counting a single contact.

`collision_radius_m = 0.25` — roughly half the chassis diagonal of `prm_2026` (base 0.42 × 0.31 m, wheels stretching width to ~0.44 m; half-diagonal ~0.30 m, with some slack). Tunable in the YAML.

### Single continuous `gp_controller` node (training and demo)

One ROS node serves both modes. The orchestrator never restarts it; instead:

1. The orchestrator updates `genome_json` + target poses + `our_team` via `SetParameters`.
2. It calls `/gp_controller/reset` (`std_srvs/Empty`) — the node zeros its current action and `holding_flag`.
3. `ign service set_pose` teleports the robot and flag to their scenario start.
4. The orchestrator spins for `scenario_duration_s`, collecting history through its own subscriptions. The controller keeps re-publishing the latest `Twist` at every tick (keep-alive against `cmd_vel_timeout=0.5s` of `diff_drive`).

`holding_flag` lives **inside** the controller (not the trainer): the controller knows when it emitted `PEGAR` and whether the robot was within `grab_reach_m` of the enemy flag. It publishes to `/gp_controller/holding_flag` with `TRANSIENT_LOCAL` QoS so `episode.py` sees the latched state.

### Budget

- `pop_size = 20`, `n_generations = 30`, `2 scenarios × 30 s` per episode, `tick_hz = 10`.
- Target RTF 3–5× via physics override in the SDF; one generation ≈ 20 individuals × 2 scenarios × ≤30 s real = ~20–40 s wall time.
- All of the above is in `config/ga_params.yaml`.

## Dependencies

- ROS 2 Humble
- Gazebo Fortress (`ign gazebo` 6.x)
- `prm_2026` package cloned into `src/` of the same workspace
- Python 3.10+, numpy, scipy, opencv (already shipped with ROS Humble)
- **Optional (only for the parallel mode):** `pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic httpx pyyaml`. Workers need fastapi/uvicorn/pydantic; coordinator needs httpx/pyyaml. Skip if you only run the single-machine flow.

## Build

```bash
cd ~/USP/Robos_moveis/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select evolutionary_controller_ros
source install/local_setup.bash
```

With `--symlink-install`, `install/` becomes a pointer to the source in `src/` — edits do not require rebuilding, only a fresh `source` (except when `setup.py` or `package.xml` change).

## Run

On WSL, `export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` is required for any terminal that brings up Gazebo (the `rsim` / `rrobo` aliases in `~/.bashrc` set it; on a fresh machine, export it manually).

There are two end-to-end flows: **training** (evolve a genome) and **CTF mission** (run the trained genome through the real game).

### Training the genome

Three terminals — Gazebo + robot + the GA orchestrator.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Gazebo world (professor's package)
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ros2 launch prm_2026 inicia_simulacao.launch.py

# Terminal 2 — Robot + controllers + RViz (professor's package)
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ros2 launch prm_2026 carrega_robo.launch.py

# Terminal 3 — gp_controller in TRAIN mode + orchestrator
ros2 launch evolutionary_controller_ros run_controller.launch.py   # in one terminal
ros2 launch evolutionary_controller_ros train.launch.py            # in another
```

Per-generation checkpoints are written to `genomes/gen_NNN_best.json`; the all-time best ends up in `genomes/best.json`. To override pop / generations:

```bash
ros2 run evolutionary_controller_ros orchestrator --ros-args \
    --params-file install/evolutionary_controller_ros/share/evolutionary_controller_ros/config/ga_params.yaml \
    -p pop_size:=10 -p n_generations:=8
```

### Running the trained genome through the CTF mission

`demo_best.launch.py` boots `gp_controller` in `mode="ctf"`, loads the genome JSON from disk, and injects the base/flag coordinates of `arena_cilindros.sdf`. The state machine then drives `genome → enemy_base → enemy_flag (PEGAR) → own_base (SOLTAR)`.

```bash
# Terminals 1 and 2 — same as training (world + robot)

# Terminal 3 — run the best genome in CTF mode
ros2 launch evolutionary_controller_ros demo_best.launch.py
# default: loads genomes/best.json, blue team
```

Custom genome path or RED-team coords:

```bash
ros2 launch evolutionary_controller_ros demo_best.launch.py \
    genome:=genomes/gen_021_best.json \
    own_base_x:=-6.0 enemy_base_x:=6.0 enemy_flag_x:=8.0
```

All overridable args: `genome`, `own_base_x/y`, `enemy_base_x/y`, `enemy_flag_x/y`, `phase_reach_radius_m` (≤ this distance from a phase target → advance), `grab_reach_m` (≤ this distance from the flag → PEGAR).

## Optional: parallel evaluation across machines

Training is dominated by Gazebo wall-time — the [timing audit](docs/timing_report_20260425.md) shows ~88 % of a generation is spent in `episode_spin` and 100 % is bound to a single Gazebo process. With `pop_size=20`, one generation takes ~55 min on a single WSL machine. Spreading individuals across N PCs (each running its own Gazebo) gives near-linear speedup until N reaches `pop_size`.

This is an **optional** alternative entry point. The single-machine flow above (`orchestrator` calling `gp_controller` in-process) keeps working untouched. If you don't have a fleet of lab PCs, ignore this whole section.

### Architecture

GA loop (lexicase, breeding) — pure Python
```

The coordinator does **not** run Gazebo and does **not** even import `rclpy`. It is pure Python with `httpx`, `pyyaml`, and a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Each worker is a fully isolated ROS environment — there is **no DDS traffic between machines**, no namespacing pain, no discovery server. The only thing that crosses the LAN is HTTP request/response payloads (~5 kB each).

A single failure on any worker (timeout, connection refused, HTTP 5xx) is retried up to `--retries` times on a different worker. Persistent failure marks the individual with a sentinel "very bad" case vector that lexicase rejects, so the GA continues without crashing.

### End-to-end recipe: from zero to a running parallel training

If you have never run this before, follow these steps in order. There are two roles of machine: **the coordinator** (one machine, your laptop) and **a worker** (every other machine, the lab PCs).

#### One-time setup on the coordinator (your laptop)

Done once per laptop, never again unless you reformat:

```bash
# 1. Get the code (skip if you already have it).
cd ~ && git clone -b parallelism-experiments \
    git@github.com:LVinaud/evolutionary_controller_ros.git

# 2. Install the two pip deps. The coordinator does NOT need ROS,
#    NOT need Gazebo, and never opens a TCP port — it only initiates
#    outgoing HTTP, so it works behind any home/lab firewall.
pip install httpx pyyaml

# 3. Copy the workers template and fill in your worker IPs.
cd ~/evolutionary_controller_ros
cp config/workers.yaml.example config/workers.yaml
$EDITOR config/workers.yaml
```

#### One-time setup on each worker PC (lab machines)

Done once per machine. The bootstrap script handles ROS install, pip deps, building, and prints the four commands you must keep alive each session:

```bash
# 1. Get the code.
cd ~ && git clone -b parallelism-experiments \
    git@github.com:LVinaud/evolutionary_controller_ros.git

# 2. Run bootstrap. Idempotent — re-run is safe.
cd ~/evolutionary_controller_ros
bash scripts/bootstrap_worker.sh
```

After the script ends, note this PC's IP (it prints `hostname -I`'s output) — it goes into the coordinator's `workers.yaml`.

#### Per-session: bring up each worker (every time you train)

On **every worker PC**, open four terminals (tmux strongly recommended so you can detach and the session survives a SSH disconnect):

```bash
# All four terminals first source the workspace and set the WSL flag.
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1   # only needed on WSL

# Terminal 1 — Gazebo + bridge (heavy, may take 15–30s to settle)
ros2 launch prm_2026 inicia_simulacao.launch.py

# Terminal 2 — Robot + ros2_control + RViz
ros2 launch prm_2026 carrega_robo.launch.py

# Terminal 3 — gp_controller (default mode "train"; orchestrator/coordinator
# pushes genome_json + target_x/y per episode via SetParameters)
ros2 run evolutionary_controller_ros gp_controller

# Terminal 4 — worker_server (this is what the coordinator talks to)
ros2 run evolutionary_controller_ros worker_server --port 8000
```

Quick smoke check that the worker is reachable from your laptop:

```bash
# from the coordinator (your laptop):
curl http://<worker-ip>:8000/health
# → {"status":"idle","uptime_s":12.4,"last_eval_s":0.0}
```

If `curl` hangs or refuses connection → see the WSL networking note below.

#### Per-session: start the coordinator (your laptop)

Once `curl /health` works for every worker in `workers.yaml`, start training:

```bash
cd ~/evolutionary_controller_ros

# Either as a ROS executable (if your laptop happens to have ROS):
ros2 run evolutionary_controller_ros coordinator \
    --workers config/workers.yaml \
    --params install/.../config/ga_params.yaml \
    --output-dir genomes/

# Or as a plain Python module (if your laptop has no ROS — same effect):
python3 -m evolutionary_controller_ros.evaluation.coordinator \
    --workers config/workers.yaml \
    --params config/ga_params.yaml \
    --output-dir genomes/
```

What you'll see on the coordinator:

```
[coord] 5 workers, pop=20 gens=30
[coord] timing log: genomes/timing_http_<timestamp>.csv
[coord] health check...
  http://lab-pc-02:8000  →  {'status': 'idle', 'uptime_s': ...}
  ...
[coord] gen 0 done: best_mean=-3.21 avg=-7.4 best_size=14
[coord] gen 1 done: best_mean=-2.85 avg=-6.9 best_size=18
...
[coord] champion saved to genomes/best.json
```

Per-generation checkpoints (`gen_NNN_best.json`) and the all-time `best.json` go into `--output-dir`. A timing CSV with one row per HTTP-call goes there too — same schema as the single-machine timing audit, plus a `worker` column.

#### Per-session: stopping

`Ctrl+C` on the coordinator. Workers stay alive and idle, ready for the next session — no need to tear down Gazebo each time. Re-running the coordinator is enough.

To take a worker offline cleanly, `Ctrl+C` Terminal 4 (`worker_server`) on that machine; the coordinator will see `connect refused` on the next dispatch and retry/redirect to other workers.

### WSL on worker PCs — networking gotcha

WSL2 by default runs on a private virtual NIC (`172.x.x.x`), so the Windows host sees the WSL but no other PC on the LAN can reach the WSL directly. Two ways out:

**Option A — port forwarding (works everywhere).** In a PowerShell prompt **as administrator** on the Windows host:

```powershell
$wslIp = (wsl hostname -I).Trim().Split(' ')[0]
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=8000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 `
  connectport=8000 connectaddress=$wslIp
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="wsl_evaluator" `
  dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8000
```

After this, the worker's URL in `workers.yaml` is the **Windows** IP (e.g. `http://192.168.0.42:8000`), not the WSL one. WSL2 changes its private IP at every reboot, so add the two `netsh` commands to a Windows scheduled task (or run them manually once before each training session).

**Option B — mirrored networking (Windows 11 22H2+).** Add to `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`:

```ini
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

Then `wsl --shutdown` and reopen WSL. Now WSL shares the Windows NIC; the worker's IP equals the host's IP and no port forwarding is needed. Cleaner if your Windows version supports it.

The coordinator side has no equivalent issue — it only makes outgoing HTTP, never accepts inbound. Your laptop on WSL is fine as a coordinator without any of this.

#### Headless Gazebo on WSL workers

A second WSL gotcha, separate from the networking one: on WSL2 + Windows 10 (no WSLg), the Gazebo Fortress GUI segfaults inside Qt's XCB clipboard plugin shortly after launch, taking the simulation server down with it. The professor's `inicia_simulacao.launch.py` starts Gazebo with `ign gazebo -r ...` (GUI on) even though its own comment says "modo headless".

The bootstrap script applies a one-line patch to that launch file, adding `-s` so Gazebo runs server-only — no GUI, no Qt, no crash. A worker never needs the GUI anyway. If you cloned `prm_2026` manually (not through `bootstrap_worker.sh`) and want server-only mode:

```bash
sed -i "s|'gazebo', '-r'|'gazebo', '-s', '-r'|" \
    ~/ros2_ws/src/prm_2026/launch/inicia_simulacao.launch.py
cd ~/ros2_ws && colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select prm_2026
```

Native Ubuntu workers and Windows 11 + WSLg workers do not need this patch — Gazebo's GUI runs cleanly there. The patch is harmless on those systems too (just suppresses the GUI window).

### HTTP API of `worker_server`

| Method + path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /evaluate` | Body: `EvaluateRequest` (see `worker_server.py`). Returns `case_vector`, `history`, and `wall_time_s`. Returns HTTP 503 if the worker is currently processing another evaluation. |
| `GET /health` | Returns `{"status": "idle"\|"busy", "uptime_s": float, "last_eval_s": float}`. The coordinator pings this at startup to verify each worker is reachable. |

The full request/response schema is the Pydantic model in [`worker_server.py`](evolutionary_controller_ros/evaluation/worker_server.py). Any service that implements the same contract is a drop-in replacement worker — this is the seam that makes turning this into a generic ROS-evolutionary framework realistic.

### Expected speedup

From the audit:

| Workers | Time per generation (`pop_size=20`) | Full 30-gen run |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 (single-machine) | ~55 min | ~27.5 h |
| 2 | ~28 min | ~14 h |
| 5 | ~11 min | ~5.5 h |
| 10 | ~6 min | ~2.8 h |
| 20 | ~3 min | ~1.4 h |

Saturates when `n_workers ≥ pop_size` — at that point each worker handles one individual per generation and adding more workers does nothing.

## Optional: parallel evaluation through a hosted Redis (relay mode)

> **Status:** experimental, lives on the `redis-relay` branch.

Some lab networks (eduroam with client isolation, tightly-firewalled VLANs, networks that NAT WSL2 weirdly) block any kind of peer-to-peer connection — even on the same SSID, machine A cannot open a TCP socket to machine B. The HTTP coordinator above does not work in that situation because the coordinator needs to reach each worker on `:8000`.

Way out: put a relay between them. Both sides only do **outbound HTTPS** to a hosted message queue, and the queue acts as the intermediary. Outbound HTTPS to `*.com` is virtually always allowed.

```

Both the coordinator and every worker only ever connect *outbound* to the Redis URL (port 6379 or 443 for `rediss://`). No firewall changes, no port forwards.

### Setup

1. **Create a hosted Redis.** [Upstash](https://upstash.com) free tier is plenty (10k commands/day; one of our generations is ~1k commands).
   - Sign in with Google, "Create Database", pick a region (sa-east or us-east).
   - Copy the `redis://` (or `rediss://` for TLS) URL.

2. **On every machine** (coordinator AND each worker):
   ```bash
   pip install redis pyyaml
   cp config/redis.env.example config/redis.env  # edit and paste your URL
   source config/redis.env
   ```

3. **On each worker** — same prep as the HTTP mode (Gazebo, robot, gp_controller running on the worker box). Then:
   ```bash
   ros2 run evolutionary_controller_ros redis_worker
   # ...connected to redis; waiting for jobs on 'evo:jobs'
   ```

4. **On the coordinator** (your laptop, may be totally outside the lab network):
   ```bash
   source config/redis.env
   ros2 run evolutionary_controller_ros redis_coordinator \
       --params install/.../config/ga_params.yaml \
       --output-dir genomes/ \
       --clear-queues
   ```

   `--clear-queues` `DEL`s `evo:jobs` and `evo:results` at startup so leftover state from a crashed previous run doesn't leak in. Use it on the first run; subsequent runs are auto-namespaced by a fresh random `run_id`.

### Wire format

Same `EvaluateRequest`/`EvaluateResponse` Pydantic shapes as HTTP mode, just transported via Redis lists instead of HTTP request/response. The Pydantic models live in [`worker_server.py`](evolutionary_controller_ros/evaluation/worker_server.py) but `redis_worker.py` parses raw JSON because it does not need request validation (the coordinator we trust).

### Trade-offs vs HTTP mode

| Axis | HTTP mode | Redis-relay mode |
|---|---|---|
| Inter-machine connectivity | required (TCP between PCs) | **not required** — only outbound HTTPS |
| External dependency | none | hosted Redis (Upstash etc.) |
| Latency overhead | one round-trip per HTTP call | two round-trips (RPUSH + BLPOP) per call |
| Coordinator can be anywhere | LAN with workers | **anywhere with internet** |
| Works on eduroam | only without client isolation | yes |
| Free tier limits | n/a | Upstash free: 10k cmd/day, 256 MB |

Two RPC round-trips vs one is irrelevant in practice — each round-trip is ~30ms vs the 165s of actual evaluation. The interesting trade is the dependency on a third party for a class project. Acceptable for an academic experiment, less so for production.

### Running tests with fakeredis

The redis-relay tests stand up an in-process `fakeredis.FakeRedis` and assert that `_evaluate_population` correctly matches results back to population slots, applies sentinels for failures, ignores stale results from older runs, and times out unresponded jobs:

```bash
pip install redis fakeredis
python3 -m pytest test/test_redis_coordinator.py -v
```

The test suite auto-skips both these tests and the HTTP coordinator tests if the optional deps are missing.

## Full structure, file by file

### Package root

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `package.xml` | ROS2 manifest — name, version, dependencies, build type (`ament_python`). `colcon` reads this file. |
| `setup.py` | Python setup + registration of **ROS2 executables** (`entry_points` section). This is where you declare "this script becomes a `ros2 run` command". |
| `setup.cfg` | setuptools config — tells it where to install the scripts. |
| `resource/evolutionary_controller_ros` | Empty file. Marker that `ament_index` uses to discover the package. Never edit. |
| `LICENSE` | MIT. |
| `README.md` | This file. |
| `.gitignore` | What does not go into git (see "What is in git" section). |

### `launch/` — launch files

Use with `ros2 launch evolutionary_controller_ros <file>`.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `run_controller.launch.py` | Brings up only the `gp_controller` node in default `mode="train"`. Used during training (the orchestrator pushes `genome_json` and `target_x/y` per episode). |
| `train.launch.py` | Brings up the `orchestrator` with parameters from `config/ga_params.yaml`. This is the training command. |
| `demo_best.launch.py` | Brings up `gp_controller` in `mode="ctf"`, loads a saved genome from disk into `genome_json`, and sets the CTF base/flag coordinates. `genome:=path/to/file.json` (default `genomes/best.json`). This is the **CTF mission runner** for an evolved genome. |

### `config/` — parameters

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ga_params.yaml` | Orchestrator parameters: GA settings (pop, generations, crossover/elite/seed), episode settings (duration, tick), collision/deploy radii, scenarios JSON, optional `seeds_json`. Consumed by both single-machine `orchestrator` and HTTP `coordinator`. |
| `workers.yaml.example` | Template for the **optional HTTP parallel mode**: list of worker URLs the coordinator should dispatch evaluations to. Copy to `workers.yaml` (gitignored) and edit. Not used by the single-machine flow or by the Redis-relay flow. |
| `redis.env.example` | Template for the **optional Redis-relay mode**: shell file with the `REDIS_URL` env var. Copy to `redis.env` (gitignored) and paste your hosted Redis URL. Both `redis_coordinator` and `redis_worker` read it. |
| `neat_config.ini` | Legacy placeholder; not used by the GP pipeline. Delete if it stays unused. |

### `evolutionary_controller_ros/` — Python code

The folder name equals the package name (`ament_python` convention).

```
evolutionary_controller_ros/
├── __init__.py             (empty — Python marker)
├── controllers/            ROS2 nodes (the "body" that drives the robot)
├── evolution/              GA core (pure Python, no ROS)
├── evaluation/             glue between ROS and the GA
└── utils/                  shared helpers
```

#### `controllers/` — the policy that drives the robot

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `__init__.py` | Empty. |
| `gp_controller.py` | Genetic-programming tree controller. At each tick, either keeps publishing the current `(action, duration_ms)` leaf's `cmd_vel` until it expires, or re-evaluates the tree with fresh features. Maintains `holding_flag` internally and publishes it latched. Exposes `/gp_controller/reset` for per-episode state cleanup. |

#### `evolution/` — the pure genetic algorithm

**This folder imports nothing from ROS.** It is plain Python, testable with `pytest` without Gazebo. That separation is what lets you iterate fast on the evolutionary part — you test a crossover in seconds, no need to bring up simulation.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `__init__.py` | Empty. |
| `genome.py` | Typed GP grammar: Bool/Float/Action types, `grow` initializer, `validate`, `evaluate`, JSON serialization (`to_json`/`from_json`), `size`. |
| `population.py` | `init_population`, type-respecting `crossover`, and the five mutation operators (subtree, point, leaf-action, leaf-duration, ERC perturbation). |
| `algorithm.py` | `compute_mad_epsilons`, `epsilon_lexicase_select`, and `run_ga`: the Koza-style GA loop with lexicase parsimony and parametric elitism. |
| `fitness.py` | `compute_fitness_cases(history)` — pure transformation of a history dict into the 7-entry fitness vector (in "larger is better" convention). No ROS, no episode running. |

#### `evaluation/` — where ROS and the GA talk to each other

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `__init__.py` | Empty. |
| `world_reset.py` | Thin wrappers around `ign service` / `ign topic`: `set_model_pose(world, name, x, y, yaw)` for teleports, `query_model_poses(world)` to snapshot every model's pose from `/world/<name>/pose/info`. |
| `episode.py` | `run_episode(node, genome_tree, scenario, world) → history` — drives one scenario through the (long-running) `gp_controller`. Pushes genome+poses via `SetParameters`, calls `/gp_controller/reset`, teleports robot+flag, spins, collects the history dict that `fitness.py` consumes. Optional `timing_log=` records per-phase wall times. |
| `orchestrator.py` | ROS2 node (`ros2 run ... orchestrator`). **Default single-machine entry point.** Queries target poses from the world, builds `WorldConfig`+scenarios, runs the GA with a per-tree evaluator that concatenates fitness vectors across all scenarios, saves the champion + per-gen checkpoints + timing CSV. |
| `worker_server.py` | **Optional parallel mode (HTTP).** ROS2 node (`ros2 run ... worker_server`) that wraps `run_episode` behind a small FastAPI app on port 8000. One per worker PC. Exposes `POST /evaluate` and `GET /health`. |
| `coordinator.py` | **Optional parallel mode (HTTP).** Pure-Python driver (`ros2 run ... coordinator` or `python3 -m ...evaluation.coordinator`). Reads a workers.yaml + ga_params.yaml, dispatches population evaluation across the worker pool over HTTP, runs the same GA loop. No `rclpy` dependency on the coordinator host. |
| `redis_worker.py` | **Optional parallel mode (Redis relay).** ROS2 node that loops over `BLPOP evo:jobs` on a hosted Redis, runs `run_episode`, pushes the result with `RPUSH evo:results`. Same role as `worker_server` but does not need any inbound connectivity — only outbound HTTPS to the Redis. |
| `redis_coordinator.py` | **Optional parallel mode (Redis relay).** Pure-Python driver paired with `redis_worker`. Pushes one job per (individual × scenario) onto Redis, drains results by job_id, runs the GA loop. Use when the lab network blocks peer-to-peer connections. |
| `timing.py` | Append-only event log used by `algorithm.run_ga`, `episode.run_episode`, and the orchestrator/coordinator to record per-phase wall times. Dumps to a CSV consumable by pandas/matplotlib. |

#### `utils/` — shared helpers

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `__init__.py` | Empty. |
| `sensors.py` | Pure function `compute_features(...)` — takes raw primitives (lidar list, labels-map uint8 array, robot pose, target poses, holding flag) and returns the normalized feature dict that `genome.evaluate()` expects. No `rclpy` import; `gp_controller` decomposes the ROS messages before calling it. |

### `genomes/` — training artifacts

The `orchestrator` writes the champion here (`best.json`). The `.gitkeep` keeps the folder in git even when empty.

### `scripts/` — tools outside ROS

Standalone scripts. Run with `python3 scripts/<name>.py` or `bash scripts/<name>.sh`. Not registered as `ros2 run` commands.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `smoke_pipeline.py` | End-to-end sanity check of the pure-Python evolution stack (population init, mutation, crossover, GA loop with a synthetic evaluator). No ROS, no Gazebo. Run before pushing to make sure the GP layer still composes. |
| `bootstrap_worker.sh` | One-shot installer for a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 box that will act as a worker PC: installs ROS2 Humble + Gazebo bridges, pip deps for `worker_server`, clones `prm_2026` and this package, `colcon build`s, prints how to bring up the four required terminals. Idempotent. |

### `test/` — unit tests

Run with `colcon test --packages-select evolutionary_controller_ros` or directly with `pytest`.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `test_genome.py` | Covers grammar construction, grow/validate, evaluate, serialization. |
| `test_population.py` | Crossover type-matching, each of the five mutations, input-immutability guarantees. |
| `test_algorithm.py` | MAD-epsilon math, lexicase survival, parsimony ordering, `run_ga` smoke test. |
| `test_fitness.py` | History-dict → case vector under each scenario shape (delivered, timeout, no-grab, collisions). |
| `test_sensors.py` | Lidar cone reduction, label centroid → left/center/right, normalization bounds. |

## What is in git

**Everything tracked**, except what `.gitignore` excludes:

| Pattern | Why exclude |
|---|---|
| `__pycache__/`, `*.py[cod]`, `*.egg-info/` | Python bytecode — regenerable. |
| `.pytest_cache/` | pytest cache — regenerable. |
| `build/`, `install/`, `log/` | colcon artifacts (in case you run `colcon build` from the package folder by mistake). Never commit — they are regenerated. |
| `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `*.swp` | Editor files — personal, do not belong in the repo. |
| `logs/` | Training CSV logs — can grow a lot. |
| `genomes/*` except `.gitkeep` and `best.json` | Intermediate genomes. Commit only the champion. |

**Remote:** `git@github.com:LVinaud/evolutionary_controller_ros.git` — branch `main`.

## Package conventions

- Code in English (variable names, comments, docstrings); Portuguese is fine in design notes / memory / this README's narrative sections.
- Each ROS2 executable is a single `.py` file with one class + a `main()` function.
- `evolution/` and `utils/sensors.py` are pure Python, no `import rclpy` — testable without a simulator.
- `controllers/` and `evaluation/` speak ROS.
- Genomes are serialized as JSON (a tree dict): human-readable, diffable, and big enough that size is a non-issue.
